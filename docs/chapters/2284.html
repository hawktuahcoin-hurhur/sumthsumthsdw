        <p>While the battered incarnation was tending to the Nameless Temple, another one was in the great hall of the ruined cathedral — which had become somewhat of a forge now.At the far end, under the watchful gaze of the Nameless Goddess, the somber shadow of the King of Swords was forging an enormous breastplate. He was using the altar as an anvil, while the material he forged to create the giant suit of armor was manifested shadows. His hammer rose and fell, shaping the shadows into form...The former King's face was still and impassive, and his gaze was strangely both full of cold intelligence and empty, lacking the spark of life. He still retained his sublime skill as a blacksmith and artisan, as well as the keen judgment necessary to employ it, but not the will and spirit that made one a person.The shadow of Anvil had neither desires nor emotions, existing in a tranquil state of silent emptiness.Still... he looked at peace, almost content, having been given a chance to dedicate himself to his craft even in death. At least Sunny thought so after observing the shadow of Anvil for countless days.Initially, he had wanted to destroy it. Sunny knew that losing the shadow of a Supreme being would be a great loss for the Shadow Legion, even if it lacked the Will. But he had still wanted to get rid of Anvil's shadow purely out of spite, feeling that its mere presence was tainting his soul.Yet he eventually decided against it.Then, he wanted to send the royal shade onto the battlefield. In the end, Sunny decided that the best use for Anvil's shadow was this — toiling as the blacksmith for the growing Shadow Legion.Sunny crafted the Memories for the members of the Shadow Clan himself, but the shadow legionnaires dwelling in his soul were too many, and different from Awakened humans as well.</p>
