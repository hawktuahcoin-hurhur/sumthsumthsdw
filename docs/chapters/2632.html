            <p class="chapter-paragraph">Surveying the sprawling legion of muted shades assembled across the plaza beneath them, Sunny drew in a long breath.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Time was scarce for careful appraisal or preparation... yet this initial clash was little more than the opening act to the terrifying war soon to engulf the Eternal City.Read full story at novel[f]ire.net</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He let out a slow breath.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Honestly, I'm not overly worried about this opening engagement. I think you'll understand why."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Jet, after all, was a seasoned commander — in fact, her experience far exceeded his. She had already held senior officer rank during the Southern Campaign, leading diverse government units through a long and distinguished career. Commanding the entire First Irregular Company was simply the next step in her ascent.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Since then, Sunny had largely faced the dangers of the Dream Realm alone, while Jet's duties multiplied dramatically. He had commanded a segment of the Sword Army at Godgrave, but that fell short next to her extensive leadership background in both civil and military affairs. In the Age of Nightmares, the lines between those realms were blurred.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He couldn't have asked for a more capable counselor.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">She inclined her head slightly.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"The Eternal City is immense, split into islands by potent currents. We've just landed; so the nightmare beings we face now are only those trapped on this specific island at our arrival.”</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Her gaze grew grave.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"The other denizens will have sensed us by now, if not, the noise of battle will betray our presence soon enough. Before long, countless foes will descend upon us from all sides, threatening to encircle our troops or cut off their route to the Night Garden.”</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">A faint smile crossed Sunny’s lips.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"What's your recommendation, then?”</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Jet paused briefly, weighing her words, before answering in a measured tone:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"This is no ordinary fight. Besides the ruling entity, two separate invaders contest the city. The terrain complicates matters, too... Normally, I'd advise fortifying our position and letting the enemy grind themselves down against our defenses, but that's off the table now."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Her eyes scanned the horizon, calculating.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"We must push forward, seize ground, and engage these unsettling immortals in a tactical game of pursuit and evasion. Above all, our advance must be steady and swift— we need a quick victory. There are two likely disasters if we fail, neither offering a hopeful outcome.”</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">sunny’s smile darkened.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He gave a solemn nod.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Right. Should the Dutchman fall, the immortals currently pinned by the wraith forces will flood down upon us, doubling the overwhelming enemy numbers. But if the wraiths take control, who can predict the horrors awaiting us? At minimum, they'll claim the treasures we seek first. I have a feeling they'll only grow more powerful from there.”</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">His gaze drifted toward a distant lighthouse casting a radiant beam, and he exhaled. "This perilous race is far from over. We're still fighting against the clock.”</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">In more ways than one. Although they had only briefly reviewed their situation, the window for planning was nearly closed.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"These are strategic questions,” Jet said, sizing him up with a keen look. "But first, we need to address tactics. How do you fight something that simply cannot die?”</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">That was indeed the crux.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny lowered his eyes to the shadow chains cocooned below. After a moment's quiet, his voice was calm.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"My shades can't be killed either—not through normal methods. Even if destroyed, they eventually regenerate, though they require time to recover. The Eternal City's immortals revive faster, it seems.”</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">A shadow crossed his features.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Between their destruction and revival, they are vulnerable—that's the moment we must seize to contain them. Provided we find a reliable way to trap them, it all boils down to arithmetic. We must incapacitate them faster than they obliterate my shades.”</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Movement near the plaza entrances drew his attention; he sighed.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"This means no swift victory or crushing defeat. It will be a war of attrition. We have to exploit every advantage and implement tactics that inflict maximal enemy losses while keeping our own low. Only then can we claim the Eternal City instead of becoming its prey.”</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Jet stretched her shoulders with a smirk.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Jet stretched her shoulders with a smirk.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"That's precisely where I landed, too. As for the finer points...” She glanced across the plaza to where a broad avenue and numerous narrow alleys funneled into the open space.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Well, I suppose we'll have to sort those out as events unfold.”</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Her tone shifted, somber and tense—because at that moment, a faint figure emerged at the mouth of a shadowed alley. Then another, and another. Soon, a small gathering formed on the plaza's edge, as if the city’s youth had come to browse a street market. All were young and stunningly beautiful, clad in light, flowing garments. Their flawless faces and sparkling eyes revealed no trace of the Corruption lurking beneath.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">None carried weapons...</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Yet their serene, inquisitive gazes sent a chill down Sunny's spine.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He inhaled deeply, then locked eyes on the distant immortals with cold resolve.</p>
