            <p>A deep yawn escaped Sunny as he kneaded his weary shoulders. Despite his status as a Saint — and an extraordinary one at that — even he had his limits. The past weeks had been nothing short of grueling: the fierce battle against Revel, the intricate process of merging with Shadows and Memories, and the relentless week of weaving...</p>
<p>His mind screamed for rest.</p>
<p>Neither of his aspects — the Lord of Shadows nor Rain's mentor — had found a moment's peace throughout this ordeal.</p>
<p>With deliberate movements, he retrieved the [Bag of Withholding], its ancient clasp creaking as he opened it to store the remaining Memories within. Task finally complete, he emerged from the Brilliant Emporium's basement, dreaming of collapsing onto the plush bed awaiting him on the second floor. But first, he made his way to the entrance, where he carefully returned the Silver Bell to its designated spot above the door.</p>
<p>«There. Back where it belongs.»</p>
<p>As he gazed at the softly gleaming bell, an odd thought struck him.</p>
<p>«How ironic.»</p>
<p>He remembered lamenting his lack of a home once, which had prompted Noctis — another Saint far from his original dwelling — to offer heartfelt counsel. While Noctis had built himself the Sanctuary, Sunny had created something quite different.</p>
<p>The Brilliant Emporium stood as testament to his peculiar nature. What kind of person crafts a home specifically designed to follow them everywhere, ensuring they could never lose it again? It spoke volumes about his deep-seated fears.</p>
<p>Yet he couldn't deny its effectiveness. Here he was, living comfortably in his cottage despite the transition from Bastion to Godgrave. A small, satisfied smile played across his lips.</p>
<p>«Perhaps I'm more clever than I give myself credit for.»</p>
<p>His thoughts wandered to the Marvelous Mimic's future form. Would it someday house both him and Nephis? The prospect filled him with warmth.</p>
<p>His smile grew as he imagined sharing this cozy space with Neph. Of course, modifications would be necessary. She'd need her own closet, though knowing her priorities, a training ground would come first.</p>
<p>Additional rooms would follow — another bathroom, an office, a proper library, and perhaps... a nursery?</p>
<p>The thought made him cough awkwardly.</p>
<p>His expression sobered as reality intruded.</p>
<p>«Ah. Right.»</p>
<p>If they survived to see that future, they would be Supreme. Nephis would be more than just powerful — she would be a queen, likely humanity's sole ruler, bearing responsibility for both their territory in the Dream Realm and their crumbling homeworld.</p>
<p>A queen couldn't very well reside in a humble cottage.</p>
<p>He released a heavy sigh before brightening slightly.</p>
<p>«Though that's not insurmountable.»</p>
<p>The Marvelous Mimic possessed another remarkable quality — its ability to reshape itself. Since its form's complexity depended on Sunny's soul strength, by the time he reached Sovereign status, his modest cottage could easily transform into a magnificent palace.</p>
<p>Sunny scrubbed his face with his hands.</p>
<p>«What strange paths my mind wanders...»</p>
<p>«Sleep. I need sleep.»</p>
<p>He turned toward the stairs, but before he could reach them, the Silver Bell's gentle chime announced Aiko's arrival. She entered the dining hall wearing a bright smile, only to freeze upon spotting him.</p>
<p>«Boss! You've emerged from the basement?»</p>
<p>«Her surprise is rather unnecessary... I'm hardly some cave-dwelling hermit!»</p>
<p>After studying her briefly, he nodded.</p>
<p>«Indeed. You seem particularly cheerful.»</p>
<p>Her grin widened.</p>
<p>«Oh! Saint Tyris has returned to camp. Which means we'll have a break from those awful Cloudbreaks. They're such a nuisance — during the last one, I was headed to the bathroom and got stuck there for four whole hours!»</p>
<p>Sunny's expression turned deadpan.</p>
<p>«That's... more information than I required.»</p>
<p>Then the significance of her words struck him.</p>
<p>«Saint Tyris has returned...»</p>
<p>Sky Tide had been traveling with Neph's group.</p>
<p>Which meant Nephis was back as well...</p>
<p>His eyes lit up with sudden energy.</p>
<p>«Finally!»</p>
<p>With renewed vigor, he turned away from Aiko and headed for the door. After a moment's consideration, though, he used Shadow Step to transport himself to the Brilliant Emporium's second floor.</p>
<p>Two weeks in the basement had left their mark on his appearance, after all.</p>
<p>Meeting Nephis looking anything less than presentable was out of the question.</p>
<p>«A thorough shower is in order...»</p>
<p>—— —— ——</p>
<p>While Sunny's anticipation for Nephis's return ran high, the entire Sword Army shared his excitement.</p>
<p>The army had split its forces between two locations. The main contingent remained at their primary camp, while the expedition force established a secondary position on the dead deity's breastbone. Nephis's return would likely trigger a reorganization of these forces — her delayed arrival stemmed from her mission to secure a safer, broader path connecting the two camps.</p>
<p>The secondary camp would function as their offensive spearhead against the Song Army, while the main camp provided rear support. The troops stationed within the Breastbone Reach represented the Sword Army's finest — veterans who had survived the nightmarish campaign to claim the Vanishing Lake Citadel, renamed after Nephis reduced most of it to ashes during her confrontation with Moonveil.</p>
<p>The main camp's soldiers were no strangers to combat either, having gradually conquered the eastern Collarbone Plain while battling the scarlet infestation. However, they knew the expedition force's trials and the battle for Vanishing Lake only through increasingly elaborate tales.</p>
<p>Whether these stories originated from Clan Valor's elders attempting to boost morale or from Cassie's careful manipulation remained unclear, but they painted grandiose portraits of Summer Knight, the Lord of Shadows, and Changing Star — particularly the latter two. Despite his self-imposed basement exile, Sunny had heard the whispers about the Lord of Shadows. Had he not been that very figure, he might have found himself impressed by the descriptions.</p>
<p>They spoke of a mysterious entity wielding unfathomable power with ruthless precision. A fearless warrior commanding darkness and death itself, leading an army of terrifying beings against countless monstrosities. Yet simultaneously, a brilliant tactician who preserved his soldiers' lives against impossible odds.</p>
<p>«Well... perhaps I am somewhat impressive.»</p>
<p>Sunny often overlooked his own extraordinary capabilities — understandable, given how his opponents seemed to grow exponentially more powerful at an alarming rate.</p>
<p>But to ordinary Awakened, the Lord of Shadows must appear truly terrifying — a being whose dark powers defied comprehension. The Sword Army's troops counted themselves fortunate to have such an ally, while the Song Army would soon learn to dread the very shadows themselves.</p>
<p>Fortunately, none suspected that the Lord of Shadows represented merely half of Sunny's true might.</p>
<p>That knowledge would have robbed them all of sleep.</p>
