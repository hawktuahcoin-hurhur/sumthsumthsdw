        <p>For all the reverence the Lord of Shadows commanded, his reputation paled before the luminous legacy of Changing Star, last scion of the Immortal Flame clan.</p>
<p>The contrast made perfect sense. Their very essences dictated their roles — one destined to lurk in darkness, the other to blaze like a beacon. More than that, while the Lord of Shadows remained an enigmatic newcomer, Nephis had long since become the beating heart of these people's hopes.</p>
<p>Their devotion ran deep, rooted in decades of admiring her illustrious family. They had witnessed her meteoric rise firsthand: her extraordinary achievement at the Forgotten Shore, her triumphant return as a Master after a solitary quest across the Dream Realm, and her unwavering protection through the tumultuous years following the Chain of Nightmares.</p>
<p>Where Sunny's connection to humanity remained tenuous, Nephis had forged bonds of steel.</p>
<p>Little wonder, then, that the Sword Army's entire camp hummed with anticipation at her return.</p>
<p>Yet more fascinating was her unexpected popularity among the Song Army's ranks.</p>
<p>At first glance, it seemed paradoxical — Changing Star stood as their declared enemy. But the same qualities that endeared her to the Sword Army resonated across battle lines. Moreover, word had spread — carefully orchestrated by Cassie, no doubt — that among all Valor's champions, only Nephis had raised her voice against the King's declaration of war.</p>
<p>Thus, while Song's warriors spat venom at the mention of other Sword Domain Saints, particularly the King himself, they spoke of the Immortal Flame's daughter with something closer to wistful regret.</p>
<p>This sentiment echoed strongest in Rain.</p>
<p>Though she seldom discussed Nephis and her companions, Sunny recognized the turmoil in his sister's heart. Her memories, though altered, held clear images: Effie as a neighbor, lessons from Nephis and Kai, casual meetings with Cassie. The prospect of facing them as enemies across a battlefield weighed heavily on her soul.</p>
<p>But Rain's struggle merely exemplified a broader tragedy. Though presented as a conflict between sovereign Domains, the war between Anvil and Ki Song cut deeper — a civil war that severed bonds of friendship and even blood. The arbitrary nature of their allegiances only twisted the knife; the Nightmare Spell had scattered people across the Dream Realm with cold indifference, and few possessed the means to traverse the vast distances between Citadels or brave the treacherous Stormsea.</p>
<p>Master Orum's fate stood as a stark example. His clan's eastern location had forced their vassalage to Valor; had the Spell cast them westward, he might have served Ki Song proudly instead of dying a «traitor» in a lightless cell.</p>
<p>Discontent simmered in both armies. As the initial shock subsided and the specter of impending bloodshed loomed closer, resentment and fear poisoned the air. Yet what choice did they have? The Supremes had spoken, and mere mortals could not defy their will.</p>
<p>Sunny, however, saw opportunity in their growing disillusionment. As the war's atrocities mounted and hearts grew heavy with grief, he knew the soldiers would become increasingly receptive to Neph's radical solution — the overthrow of the very Sovereigns who had forced them into this fratricidal conflict.</p>
<p>The enthusiastic welcome greeting Nephis suggested his calculations proved accurate. Even Sunny's fearsome reputation as the Lord of Shadows would serve their cause. In this realm where might made right, his apparent allegiance to Nephis would legitimize her authority. After all, what better proof of her power than her ability to command such a terrifying force?</p>
<p>Sunny lingered at the warcamp's gates, listening to the excited chatter of the crowd:</p>
<p>«They've returned!»</p>
<p>«The Fire Keepers all made it...»</p>
<p>«Glory! Glory!»</p>
<p>Whispers about his alter ego filtered through as well.</p>
<p>These celebrations masked a bitter truth — the victory at Vanishing Lake had come at a devastating cost. Seven Saints lost, each death not only weakening humanity's defenses but guaranteeing more casualties in the battles to come.</p>
<p>Though some knew the truth — the bereaved clans had been informed, and word had spread — most preferred to focus on more palatable narratives: the triumph of Changing Star and the Lord of Shadows, the supposed defeat of Dark Dancer Revel and her sisters.</p>
<p>But such concerns could wait.</p>
<p>For now, after far too many days apart, Sunny had eyes only for Nephis.</p>
<p>His smile softened with genuine warmth.</p>
<p>«There you are.»</p>
