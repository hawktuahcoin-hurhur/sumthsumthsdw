            <p>Sunny released a deep breath, then sank into thought. He examined the map for a moment, his gaze concealed by thick shadows... after a while, however, he glanced at Kai.</p>
<p>"We're missing details about the guidelines of this realm, and attempting to discover more through experimentation appears too risky. This puts us in a regrettably reactive position. We have no option — no smarter choice, anyway — but to hold until the foe reveals their plan. We'll gain better insight about Ariel's Game by observing the Snow Abominations' behavior."</p>
<p>He frowned.</p>
<p>"You noted that the bugs in the ice colony seemed to be gradually stirring, while the remaining two Beasts haven't budged yet. It's not unexpected, honestly, given they must have endured countless years trapped in this game. But... now that we've arrived, they'll likely become alert soon."</p>
<p>Sunny watched Kai for several seconds, then inquired:</p>
<p>"Meanwhile... you commanded troops in your Second Nightmare and in Antarctica, correct? You also spent sufficient time with Morgan to pick up various tactics from her. What approach do you believe we should take?"</p>
<p>Kai lifted an eyebrow and paused briefly.</p>
<p>"I... feel somewhat startled to hear mention of my Second Nightmare from you, Sunny. But if you're aware what happened to us in the Kingdom of Hope, you know that the only achievement I gave my troops was their demise. Regarding Antarctica, my job there was simply that of a battlefield director. Our overall approach was typically determined by Army HQ."</p>
<p>Sunny grinned.</p>
<p>"Nightingale... Kai, my companion. I realize you're haunted by self-doubt, but please, for heaven's sake, don't allow it to grow into a feeling of inadequacy around me. Too much humility isn't becoming for a respected gentleman — even one as striking as yourself. So quit it and embrace your achievements, just once."</p>
<p>Kai stared at him, an unusual feeling hidden in his remarkable green eyes.</p>
<p>Sunny exhaled.</p>
<p>The likable Saint was frequently too kind for his benefit, but that wasn't his sole character flaw. He was also uncertain about himself, at his core. Sunny realized that Kai had constantly felt somewhat unsure about his role in the cohort... and consequently, in the larger world.</p>
<p>He could grasp these concerns, to an extent. Indeed, the individuals in Changing Star's cohort were remarkable people, each one of them — from the beginning at the Forgotten Shore. There was Nephis herself, Cassie with her fortune-telling ability, Sunny and his Fated meetings, and Effie, who had lasted years hunting alone through the streets of the Dark City.</p>
<p>Later, there was also Soul Reaper Jet — a Master whom even Saints respected.</p>
<p>By contrast, Kai was a much more ordinary person. He had endured the dangers of the Dark City inside the walls of the Bright Castle, getting soul shards to handle Gunlaug's demands by marketing his scarce Aspect Ability. In a way, he shared more traits with someone like Aiko than with the powerful fighters surrounding him.</p>
<p>Yet Kai had met every challenge whenever his assistance was needed — for no purpose beyond his basic decency and values. He wasn't pushed by some powerful fixation or dragged into action by unavoidable destiny... instead, he merely tried his hardest to perform what he believed was the correct action.</p>
<p>From the terrible reaches of the Forgotten Shore to the gloomy vastness of the Tomb of Ariel, he improved himself gradually until barely a handful of individuals in the world could claim they had done more, or withstood more, than Saint Nightingale — the brave Dragonslayer.</p>
<p>It was just that Kai's assessment of himself never appeared to match his deeds.</p>
<p>Sunny might not have appreciated that his friend was always undervaluing himself, but there was little he could do about it. After all, there was some truth to what Kai believed about himself — it would have been difficult for anyone, not just him, to rival incredible figures like Sunny, Nephis, or other giants in their circle.</p>
<p>But now... now, Kai's lack of confidence wasn't merely undeserved, it was a genuine problem. Sovereigns were naturally proud, after all — they had to be. Only someone extremely sure in their cause could be daring enough to impose their will upon the world.</p>
<p>How could someone who questioned himself persuade the world to yield?</p>
<p>So, Sunny hoped to free Kai from the absurd idea that he was somehow less worthy than the rest of them.</p>
<p>'Well, I'm really not the ideal person for this task...'</p>
<p>Actually, he was arguably the worst pick — after all, Sunny had never been skilled at handling people. He was so terrible at it, in fact, that he had even wound up living by himself in isolation and slowly losing his sanity multiple times throughout his life.</p>
<p>But simultaneously, he was also the ideal pick.</p>
<p>Because Kai was sharply aware of deception and fakeness, while Sunny never deceived.</p>
<p>Kai watched him with a strange look for a bit.</p>
<p>Finally, he asked in a wary voice:</p>
<p>"Sunny... you think I'm striking?"</p>
<p>Sunny blinked several times.</p>
<p>"T—that... that is your main conclusion?!"</p>
<p>He breathed out slowly through clenched teeth.</p>
<p>"Jerk, are you hunting for praise now? Fine, yes, I do think that. Your fashion is flawless, and your face is a tool of widespread destruction. Satisfied now?!"</p>
<p>Kai beamed brightly.</p>
<p>"Well, thank you! It truly matters, coming from the proprietor of the Eye Candy Ca..."</p>
<p>"Be quiet!"</p>
<p>Sunny huffed and motioned toward the map of Ariel's Game.</p>
<p>"Strategy! Remember?"</p>
<p>Kai kept beaming for a moment, then turned to the grid sketched in the ash. A soft sigh escaped from his lips.</p>
<p>"We truly don't understand much about how this game functions, but generally... the mountain we are holding is the Castle, which hints at some kind of defensive benefit. Basic reasoning suggests that we should utilize these defenses to block the enemy, but actually, such a plan will merely become our downfall. Since the opposing forces are so massive, confining ourselves to a defensive plan will only delay our defeat."</p>
<p>Sunny nodded.</p>
<p>Kai was, without question, right on that point.</p>
