        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny reached Bastion in the dead of night. He tied the boat to the pier, climbed ashore, and walked slowly in the direction of the Brilliant Emporium. There was a lot on his mind, so he was not in a hurry to get home.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Eventually, though, he did.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">The Marvelous Mimic opened its door unprompted to welcome him back. It even retracted the terrifying fangs, which were usually out at night, back inside the door frame.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny patted the lintel, walked into the dining hall absentmindedly, placed the picnic basket on a table, and sighed.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He was a bit tired, but doubted that he would be able to sleep tonight.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">And indeed, Sunny wasn't able to douse the flames blazing in his mind for a long time. He tossed and turned in the bed, only falling asleep shortly before dawn.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">As a result, he overslept, only waking up from the sounds of Aiko entering the shop. Since his petite assistant had showed up for work, the morning crowd wasn't far behind, either.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny sat up and rubbed his face, then went about washing up for the long day ahead.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">'Will she come?'</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He figured that Nephis would need a long time to sort her feelings out, but still put extra effort into making himself look presentable on the off chance that she would not.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Aiko's voice resounded from downstairs while he was in the middle of his routine.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Hey, boss! What should I do with the basket?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny swept his wet hair back and responded casually:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"... Ah there are some dirty dishes inside. Give them a rinse."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He washed them in the river yesterday, but everything still needed to be cleaned properly.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny continued to get himself ready. There were no mirrors inside the Mimic, so he used the gloomy shadow to look at himself instead.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Needless to say, the shadow was not amused by having to stare at his mug first thing in the morning... or ever, really.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">'That guy never changes...'</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">It was then that Sunny froze, opened his eyes wide, then dashed down while summoning the Nebulous Mantle.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"N0, Aiko! Wait!"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">But it was too late.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">The petite girl was standing in the kitchen, the picnic basket floating in the air by her side. It was open, and Aiko... was holding a beautiful white dress in her hands.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny grew still.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"That..."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">She looked at him with wide eyes and asked in a small voice:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Boss... uh... why did you bring a girl's dress back from your picnic?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny stammered:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"It's n—not what you think... I didn't do anything!</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">She just ran off... without her dress... it happened that way..."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Aiko stared at the dress silently.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Then, a small frown appeared on her face.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Wait a minute... these measurements..."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">In the next moment, she was standing next to Sunny, poking him in the chest with a finger.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"That is Changing Star's dress! You! You debaucherous scoundrel! What did you do to Nephis? !"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny softened the Onyx Shell, afraid that Aiko would bruise her finger, and pretended to reel back from her jabs.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"I didn't do anything! We were just escaping the heat in the river... and what do you mean, scoundrel? ! Weren't you the one who encouraged me to strike while the iron was hot? !"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"When did I ever? !"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Ouch! I don't remember! But you definitely did!"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">It was then that the silver bell hanging above the door rang, and they both froze.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Someone was standing at the entrance, looking at them calmly.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Tasteful white clothes, beautiful figure, lustrous silver hair...</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny's heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">It was Nephis.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">She lowered her gaze and looked at the dress, which Aiko was still holding in her hand.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Nephis smiled politely.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Oh. I've been looking for that."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Walking into the kitchen, she took it from the petite girl's hand and looked at Sunny with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Thank you for picking it up, Master Sunless."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He inhaled slowly.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"... Ah y—yes. Sure."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Why was she acting so nonchalant? What was she thinking?</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">'Did she come here to... to condemn me, or to embrace me?'</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He gulped and asked cautiously:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"I. . I hope everything is fine. After what happened yesterday."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Nephis nodded curtly.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"It's fine."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Then, she frowned a bit and mumbled quietly:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"No, actually, now that I think about it... after what happened last night, I'll need to replace some furniture...'</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny flinched.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"... What?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">At the same time, Aiko's eyes widened even more.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"What? !"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Nephis looked at them in confusion.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Oh. Sorry. I was just talking to myself."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">She paused for a moment, noticing their expressions, and then added hesitantly:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Uh... did I say something wrong again?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">***</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Eventually, Sunny managed to leave stunned Aiko behind and lead Nephis to somewhere more private.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">And now that they were there, he was silently cursing himself.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">'No, but... am I an idiot? Why didn't I go downstairs, to the Memory shop? Why did I bring her upstairs instead? !'</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Currently, there were... in his bedroom.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">While Sunny was berating himself, Nephis looked around with curiosity.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Is that where you sleep? This version of you, I mean."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny forced out a smile.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"... Ah yes. At least one incarnation of me has to, from time to time. The others don't sleep, but since I am supposed to be the most human one, I do."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He silently evaluated his bedroom and thanked the dead gods for the habit of always making his bed first thing in the morning. The room was clean and cozy, with a beautiful view of the Mirror Lake beyond the window. The Castle was bathed in the golden light of dawn... and there, above it, the Ivory Island was shrouded by clouds.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Nephis stared at his bed for a few moments, as if trying to remember something, then turned away and looked out of the window.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">A hint of a smile appeared on her lips.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"I think I can see my window from here."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny would lie if he said that he had not spent plenty of time staring at the distant silhouette of the Ivory Tower, so he kept silent.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Instead, he gestured to a few items decorating his room.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"These are some curios that I collected in the Dream Realm over the years. They are... nothing much. But exploring the past is one of my hobbies."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Nephis studied them for a while, then turned to face him and said simply:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"I know."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"You... know?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">She hesitated for a few moments.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"The Exploration Report on the Tomb of Ariel, written by Nobody. You are Nobody... aren't you?"</p>
