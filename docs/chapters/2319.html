            <p class="chapter-paragraph">Observing Kai, Sunny experienced a deep feeling of humor. However, that humor came and disappeared quickly.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Releasing a breath, he glanced upward. The sky of the tiny realm was hidden by the clouds of ash, but it appeared clear above the snowy mountains. It looked like the moon was sinking... the night would end soon, giving way to the light of day.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Somehow, Sunny sensed that this brief period of calm wasn't going to continue much longer than the night.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">'What will the Snow Tyrant attempt?'</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">And what could the Snow Tyrant attempt?</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Actually, Sunny noticed the faint oddness of his situation. He had taken the role of the Ash Tyrant... who was a character of crucial importance, certainly, but merely a character nonetheless.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny wasn't the player.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">His belief that there existed a difference between the two rested on several facts. Primarily, if the players of Ariel's Game were meant to serve as Tyrants of their respective Domains... then there would be no Snow Tyrant anywhere in this manufactured world — after all, the original players of the game had vanished long ago.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Additionally, his position as the Ash Tyrant hadn't given Sunny any fresh abilities — including the ability to direct lesser Ash figures. Kai and Slayer weren't forced to follow him because of the rules of the game, they simply heard him out because he was Sunny.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Likewise...</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">If there existed a Snow Tyrant on the opposite side of the board, would they have any influence over the Snow Abominations?</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He couldn't be certain.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Based on the answer, though, Sunny confronted two entirely separate dangers.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">If the Snow Tyrant could manage the figures freely, then he would face an organized and deadly force. This game would become a contest of two minds. If not... the Beasts would wander freely, and the main challenge blocking his path would be this manufactured realm itself.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"We'll know soon."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Kai lifted an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"What?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny released another breath.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"We'll know what type of battle this is once the Snow Abominations begin to move."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He examined the three snowy mountains.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"If they're simple Beasts, they'll hurry to consume us immediately. If they're servants of a Tyrant, though... they'll seize the other two volcanoes first, to strengthen the Snow Domain and weaken the Ash Domain as much as possible before the final attack. Our reaction will vary greatly depending on what they choose to do."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He formed a needle from shadows and started completing a quiver for Kai. Less than a minute later, it was finished.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny placed the arrows he had built into the quiver and handed it to the appealing archer with a grin.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Here... this should work for now."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Getting up, Sunny wiped the ash from his clothes and motioned to the column of smoke climbing into the sky behind them.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"We should likely investigate the castle while we can."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">As they moved down into the crater, Sunny looked at Kai, and then asked quietly:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"You have some practice battling Great Nightmare Creatures, correct?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Kai nodded.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Yes. As a government Saint, during the conflict in Bastion, and afterward as the guardian of Ravenheart... I've encountered a few."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny grinned darkly.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"How did it go?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Kai's face turned serious.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"...Like challenging gods."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He stayed quiet for several moments, then added with a sigh:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"The Great Ones... are tougher and more terrifying than monsters of lower Ranks, true. But I've long grown used to fighting against enemies who outmatch me in all aspects. The issue is that confronting them feels unlike a standard fight. It's as if reality itself supports their side."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny nodded.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Reality does indeed support their side — because they compel reality to support their side. What divides those Great and Supreme from those of lower Ranks is the strength of our determination. Our determination is dominating enough to control reality... to some extent, at least. Well, you must understand all that already — after all, both Nephis and I spent considerable time sharing our knowledge with Cassie, who then produced a document for those who need to be informed."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Kai watched Sunny with a remote expression.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Yes, I understand. However... I regret saying this, Sunny, but I don't believe that anyone else will manage to duplicate what you two have achieved — reaching Supremacy naturally, I mean. That... that isn't my lack of confidence talking. It's just that you and Nephis often fail to recognize how remarkable you are. Failing to recognize it severely."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny pressed his lips together.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Kai, meanwhile, released a sigh.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"...Which means that the rest of us will need to do it the conventional way. We will need to face the Fourth Nightmare."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny watched him for a while, then looked elsewhere.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Only four individuals have ever lived through the Fourth Nightmare. You will meet Great Nightmare Creatures there, too... so, consider this small trip of ours as training. I'll deal with the Cursed Ones, if we must confront any, but the Great nightmare creatures will be your task. I'm confident you'll succeed — after all, I..."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny wanted to mention how he had slain a Great Devil as a Sleeper, but stopped himself for once. Now wasn't the moment for jokes.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"I'll support you. You have two ideal instructors with you, anyway. I am a Supreme myself, while she..."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He pointed toward Slayer.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"She is probably the most successful killer I have ever known. Not only that, but her main killing instrument is a bow, as well. So observe her closely, and learn from her."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">There was truly no better example for Kai than Slayer. So, Sunny had great expectations for him.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Having two skilled archers helping him against the Snow Abomination sounded wonderful, too — he was seldom blessed with such assistance.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Kai smiled.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"I will."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny paused for a few moments, considering what else to mention.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">It wasn't about encouraging Kai to try his hardest — he had never lacked encouragement. It was more about showing him a viewpoint that would make him want to do beyond his hardest. To have the desire to triumph no matter what.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">This was the sole way to endure in the harsh world of the Nightmare Spell.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Finally, Sunny asked:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Your Nightmares. How did you endure them?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Kai thought about his question for a while, then replied with a slight smile:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"I endured because of the people who stood beside me."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny nodded.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Indeed. Because nobody survives in the Dream Realm alone."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He gazed at Kai and added flatly:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"But to those people, you were and will be the person standing beside them. Their survival will rely on you, just like your survival will rely on theirs."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Kai's look shifted subtly, and his smile faded.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Seeing that shift, Sunny glanced away.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"So, how many more people will endure the Fourth Nightmare in the future depends on you. Accept responsibility."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Kai stayed quiet for a long time, then nodded silently.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">By then, they had arrived at the crumbling castle.</p>
