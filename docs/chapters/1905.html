        <div class="chapter-content" data-chapter="1905">
            <p class="chapter-paragraph">Unexpectedly, the Citadel housed multiple expansive subterranean levels. This was logical, given the ephemeral nature of the surrounding lake—it would rise when the Hollows were submerged and recede once the waters traversed the remnants of the deceased deity into its colossal spine.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Consequently, these underground levels were only beneath the surface when the lake was at its peak. Most of the time, they remained above water, featuring an additional grand entrance located lower than the immense hall where the ambush had occurred.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny discovered the Gateway beneath a crystalline dome nearby that entrance.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He stood motionless for several moments, astonished by the sights and sensations before him. Behind the dome’s transparent walls, a small grove thrived. Outside, scarlet vines wrapped around the structure, yet inside, ordinary plants flourished.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Lush green grass, ancient oak trees, soft moss, and vibrant flowers adorned the hidden meadow’s center, where a serene pond of clear water lay still in the peaceful darkness. Subtle ripples disturbed the pond’s surface, hinting at an underlying current that Sunny couldn’t immediately discern.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">These were the first plants Sunny had encountered in Godgrave that remained untouched by Corruption—in the entire Dream Realm, except perhaps those introduced by the inhabitants of the waking world.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Moreover, as he entered the crystal dome, Sunny felt a profound sense of sanctity permeate the air, untouched by the corruption that plagued the rest of the cursed area. Intricate carvings adorned the dome’s perimeter, their patterns reminiscent of ancient protective spells that hinted at forgotten lore.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">“The pond serves as the Gateway.”</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny glanced at the placid water, unable to gauge its depth. With a shrug, he turned away and melded back into the shadows, rejoining Nephis and the other Saints.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Soon, they all took shelter in the grove.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Above them, the Citadel was ablaze and deteriorating. Its walls, sturdy enough to withstand the scorching flames summoned by Nephis, held for a time. However, the structure had been overtaken by the scarlet infestation over the years—the vines and trees piercing its framework acted as fuel, allowing the fire to spread and consume the ancient walls.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Amidst the chaos, faint echoes of old chants resonated through the flames, suggesting that the Citadel’s ancient defenses were beginning to reactivate. These sounds hinted at dormant mechanisms that might offer unexpected aid or pose new threats.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">The flames would soon reach the lower levels, but Nephis could defend at least one floor from being engulfed.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">The bloodied Saints sat quietly on the grass, exhausted and shaken. Only Sir Jest appeared somewhat content, though he remained silent, focused on cleaning the cane he had picked up before descending to the ground level.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">One of them needed to erase Revel's mark on the Citadel and replace it with their own. However, six of the seven surviving Saints already controlled their own Citadels, making it impossible to take over another without relinquishing their current authority. The ideal candidate was the Saint injured during the ambush, but he was unconscious.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">After a brief discussion, the Saints of the Sword Army decided to wait for the time being. They contemplated reinforcing their defenses and utilizing the grove’s sanctuary to strategize their next moves, aware that the fluctuating lake levels could offer both opportunities and obstacles.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Of course, Sunny could have seized the Citadel himself. With his seven incarnations, he could establish seven tethers instead of one—but he chose not to reveal this to the King of Swords. Instead, he simply sat down and gazed into the distance, contemplating the fragile balance of their current position.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">There was much on his mind.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">The battle—they had technically won. They repelled the ambush and took control of the Citadel’s Gateway, achieving the expedition’s objective. Soon, the King of Swords' influence would extend to central Godgrave, with his Domain spanning from the Clavicle Plain to the Breastbone Reach.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Even if Seishan and her Seventh Legion captured the western Citadel, the Song Domain would still control fewer Citadels, possess less territory, and struggle to penetrate deeper into the Hollows from their distant stronghold.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Today, the Sword Army had secured a victory.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">However, it was a Pyrrhic victory.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny sighed.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Revel’s retreat was partially advantageous for the Song forces. Yes, they had lost the Citadel, but their enemy had also suffered significant losses.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Seven Saints from the Sword Domain were dead.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Silent Stalker had taken more lives than anyone else, killing three of the Sword Army’s Transcendent champions. Lonesome Howl and her Reflections followed, with two kills among them. Moonveil had slain one, and the final fallen Saint was defeated by the risen dead. Revel hadn’t killed anyone personally, but she had orchestrated the entire battle.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">In contrast, the Song Army only lost three of Mordret's Reflections. While their loss was notable, it paled compared to the casualties endured by Nephis' team.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">The Sword Army was already disadvantaged with fewer Saints. Losing seven champions widened the gap in Transcendents between Valor and Song, likely affecting all future battles negatively.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Thus, none of the actual victors were pleased.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Concealed behind his mask, Sunny cast a furtive glance at Nephis.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">She had already finished tending to Sir Jest and his own wounds. Now, she sat by the pond, gazing at the water with her usual detached demeanor. A faint aura surrounded her, suggesting she had begun to unlock a new aspect of her power.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">She was in a difficult position.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">As the commander of the expedition, Nephis bore responsibility for her people's deaths—each loss must have weighed heavily on her. Sunny understood the agony of failing those who had trusted you with their lives. Many soldiers had perished to reach the Citadel, and now, seven Saints were dead—each a unique talent and trusted companion.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Nephis had more leadership experience than he did, having ordered more people to their deaths. However, one never becomes accustomed to such losses... Well, perhaps that wasn't entirely true. Anvil and Ki Song seemed to have developed a considerable tolerance for sacrificing lives for their goals, and there were likely others like them.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">But Nephis had not. She was likely suffering deeply.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Moreover, while leading these warriors, she was also plotting against their king. In a way, she was an outsider among them—a traitor, even. Her primary concern was who would control the Citadel, aiming to weaken the two Sovereigns against each other.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Navigating this situation must have been challenging, both morally and emotionally.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Adding to this was the fact that her capacity for emotions and morality—her humanity—was somewhat diminished by the consuming flames of her Aspect. Recently, she had started experiencing fleeting visions of an alternate path, hinting at a deeper internal conflict.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny wanted to speak with her, but they couldn’t have an honest conversation while surrounded by the other Saints.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">After some time, the members of the conquest party regained their composure—or perhaps they simply grew weary of the silence—and began discussing the battle, sharing their experiences. The conversation gradually shifted to the structural integrity of the Citadel and the mysterious mechanisms that seemed to be activating in response to the ongoing destruction.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny listened for a while, learning about Moonveil and Lonesome Howl’s capabilities. He briefly recounted his own encounter with Revel, which earned him a stern look from Nephis.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">After that, he couldn’t wait any longer. The fire was already creeping up to this level, and the ground had trembled violently some time ago, indicating the upper levels of the Citadel had collapsed. Since Nephis was busy preventing the flames from damaging the crystal dome, Sunny announced he would check the situation above and vanished into the shadows.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He intended to check on Saint and assess any changes in her condition that might influence their next moves.</p>
