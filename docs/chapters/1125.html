        <div class="chapter-content" data-chapter="1125">
            <p class="chapter-paragraph">Today, luck was on Sunny's side. Usually, he would not have been able to listen in on the really important conversations between the emissaries of the great clans. They were too cautious... and he was very cautious, as well. Perhaps he could overcome the defensive measures his targets had in place, but the cost of failure was too great. So, he had been reluctant to try.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">But today, maybe because of the clamor and pressure of the ongoing clash with the Nightmare Creatures that had been drawn to the battlefield, the representatives of both Song and Valor had been slightly neglectful. And since Sunny had already spent a month learning how to get closer to them, he managed to witness two very interesting conversations.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">The first one was between Morgan and Madoc. The two members of the Valor family remained in the stone fort on top of the giant Echo's carapace, speaking about something as they observed the constant stream of abominations being ground against the outer perimeter of the camp. Of course, no one could hear what they were saying, since the two were surrounded by an invisible barrier that prevented any sound from coming out. Even the movement of their lips was obscured. There were Memories active that made it almost impossible for someone to divine the conversation, as well.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">...However, Sunny was not a diviner. Much more importantly, he managed to get inside the circle of silence by hiding his own shadows in the shadow of one of Valor's Awakened. The man had been invited to make a report, and so, Morgan herself led him through the layers of wards surrounding the fort.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">When the Awakened arrived, she studied him for a few moments, then asked in a neutral tone: "Is there news, Squire Warren?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">The Awakened shifted slightly. He tried to hide his excitement at the fact that she knew his name, but failed miserably - Sunny mentally rolled his eyes, while Morgan pretended not to notice. Well, the poor man could not be blamed. How often did ordinary Awakened retainers in service of the great clan closely interact with its princess? Very rarely, most likely.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Morgan was a striking person, as well - despite her coldness and sharpness, she was someone even Sunny found hard to look away from. There was just something about the young woman and her vibrant vermilion eyes that demanded attention. Not to mention the fact that she was quite literally a member of exalted royalty.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">In any case, Squire Warren did have something to report. He bowed to Morgan and Madoc, then spoke in a deep, respectful voice: "We received word from Knight Shtad, my lady. His cohort had survived the second night and secured a fortified position. Their report indicates that the divination seems to have been correct."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">At the mention of that last part, Madoc and Morgan exchanged a glance, their expressions subtly changing. Back in the tent, Sunny frowned. 'Knight Shtad...' He was one of the Masters that had arrived with Summer Knight. His cohort had been among those secretly sent to search for suitable Nightmare Gates. It appeared that they were already in the Dream Realm, and had found something important to boot.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Morgan lingered for a few moments, then sighed. "Finally, some good news... what about the rest of the scouts?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Squire Warren looked down and gritted his teeth. "Lost or forced to enter the Seeds, my lady. However, now that we have secured several entry points... the next cohorts we send will survive, honoring their sacrifice."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">She nodded. "Indeed..."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">At that point, Madoc finally spoke. "The most important thing right now is to reinforce Shtad. His mission might very well decide the outcome of this phase of the conflict. Warren... tell your men to prepare. Once we return to the siege capital, I will personally transport you to the desert. You must succeed at any cost." He lingered for a moment, and then added: "...If my niece does not object, of course."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Morgan smiled. "Why would I? Squire Warren has a sharp blade, and his comrades are the same. They will bring clan Valor glory."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">The Awakened man lowered his head, his eyes igniting with exhilaration and zeal. "You honor me, Lady Morgan! Sir Madoc... we won't let you down!" Whispering Blade smiled. "Of course you won't. You are warriors of Valor, after all..."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Beaming with pride, Squire Warren left. Sunny's shadow, however, remained. Which was why it heard Morgan's voice change slightly as she addressed Madoc: "Shouldn't we send someone more powerful?" Whispering Blade shook his head. "Don't be impatient. It's too early to risk our champions. Once the target is secured, we will have an almost insurmountable advantage over the Blood Daughters... then, we can truly begin."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Morgan looked away and grimaced. "I know. It's just that... you know what is at stake." She remained silent for a few moments, then smiled. "...Should we send Nephis, then?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Madoc's face changed slightly. "Don't even think about it. You know how your father feels about her."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Morgan sighed, then looked in the direction of the battlefield. "Fickle man..."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Far away, hidden safely in the tent, Sunny was frowning. What exactly had the scouts found in the desert? What was the insurmountable advantage Valor wanted to secure at all costs? At this stage in the race toward the Black Pyramid, both clans were trying to establish a foothold in the desert. They were slowly ramping up the search for Nightmare Gates that led to relatively safe areas, to use them as entry points for the expedition forces.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">A few of these areas had apparently already been found. What else could Knight Shtad be hunting for? Some kind of precious resource or revelation about that region of the Dream Realm? A natural stronghold that could serve as a fortress for the forces of Valor? A Citadel, even? There was that last part of the conversation, as well... It was, honestly, rather disturbing. There seemed to be something complicated going on within clan Valor. But Sunny had no idea what.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Strangely enough... it was the emissaries of Song that helped him shed some light on that situation. Because they were currently talking about Nephis, as well.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">In a distant part of the camp, within the circle of armored vehicles, a lavish tent had been raised. Beastmaster and Seishan were inside. At the moment, Beastmaster was enjoying a bowl of fresh fruit as she looked at her sister with a pleasant smile. Her words, however, were anything but pleasant.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Beastmaster was saying: "...should we kill that girl, Changing Star?"</p>
