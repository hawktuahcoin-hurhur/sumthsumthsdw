            <p class="chapter-paragraph">Nephis nodded, indicating that she had read the description of the Crown of Twilight. The two of them could have communicated through the [Blessing of Dusk] to discuss how they would approach the conversation with Ananke... but really, there was no need. The old woman showed no indication of being someone they needed to be wary of. So, they could simply ask. There was one question that had to be answered above all else, though. Sunny shifted slightly, then called:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Grandmother..."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Ananke stirred, as if waking up from a dream, and looked at them with her cloudy eye. "Yes, my Lord?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Still uncomfortable with this form of address, Sunny thought for a moment and asked:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Have you ever heard about... that which was defiled?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">The old woman suddenly froze. Her hand, which was resting on the steering oar, trembled. For a while, nothing but the sound of water splashing against the hull of the ketch could be heard. It seemed that she wasn't happy to hear that question. However, Sunny and Nephis had no choice but to ask it — they needed to learn everything they could about the assumed goal of this Nightmare.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Eventually, Ananke sighed.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"That which was defiled... I guess you are talking about the Defilement, my Lord."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny's eyes glinted. "The... Defilement?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Remembering the horrors of the Southern Campaign, he made a sudden connection. There were three Nightmare Creatures he had slain that bore a similar name — the Defiled Witness, the Defiled Herald, and the Defiled Seeker of Truth. The first one was the Fallen Demon who led the pack of eyeless beasts. The second was the Corrupted Devil who led the group of desiccated corpses, their mouths sewn shut — Sunny had received the Stifled Scream after that battle. The third one was the Fallen Titan he had killed by chance during the joint battle against the enormous horde of abominations in East Antarctica, receiving the Mirror of Truth. Had all of them come from the Tomb of Ariel?</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">The old woman nodded. "Yes... the Defilement. I am sorry, my Lord and Lady. I should have known that you would not be aware of these matters. You are Outsiders, after all."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny and Nephis glanced at each other, wondering what she meant. Ananke remained silent for a few moments, then spoke solemnly:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"...To understand what the Defilement is, you will first need to learn a little about the history of the Great River. I will try to explain as well as I can."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Nephis frowned slightly. "The history? I am not sure I understand what history a river that flows through time can possess."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">The old woman smiled faintly. "Time within the Tomb of Ariel is unpredictable and convoluted. Sometimes, it flows slowly, while sometimes it flows swiftly. Sometimes, time rises in great storms, or grows stale, or circles forever as a whirlpool. Currents merge and separate, or disappear without a trace. But, nevertheless... for most of us, unless we enter turbulent waters, time always moves. Just like in the outside world. It is just that our own time is different from the time there."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Noticing a hint of confusion on their faces, Ananke looked thoughtful for a while. Then, she sighed:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"The best way I can explain it is like this — the Great River does indeed flow from the future into the past, but that is only in relation to the outside world. Here, this kind of time is no different from space. However, the River still has a past, a present, and a future in relation to itself. Here, this kind of time is just like the time of the Outside."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Nephis tilted her head a little. "So, one can say that Sunny and I entered the Tomb of Ariel in a distant future — meaning much higher upstream. But one can also say that we entered a month ago? Both distance and days are a measure of time?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">The old woman nodded. "Indeed. You are wise, my Lady."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">The corner of Sunny's mouth twitched. 'That's the second time she calls Nephis wise... zero times for me, though!'</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Still, he understood the idea. There were actually two concepts named "time" inside the Tomb of Ariel — one was the flow of the Great River itself, which was prone to all kinds of shenanigans, while the second was no different from the concept of time they were familiar with. The old woman continued:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"So, the Great River has a history, as well. Or rather, it is us, the River People, who have it. That history... started a long time ago, when the sybils first entered the Tomb of Ariel with their people. There were others, too — all kinds of humans and creatures who came seeking truth, which is said to be hidden at the Estuary." Her creaky voice grew wistful:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"That was when we, heralds of the Nightmare Spell, came to the Great River as well. I was told that it was a golden age. The sybils established their cities, and powerful Seekers built solitary manors among the waves. They had escaped the end, and lived in peace and prosperity within the Tomb of Ariel."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny found something curious and asked:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"You were told? You weren't there yourself?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Come to think of it, when Ananke had spoken about the persecution of the followers of Weaver, she had mentioned not experiencing it personally. That statement had sounded rather strange at the time, but there were many other questions that needed to be asked first. The old woman chuckled. "Goodness... of course, no. I might look old, but I am not that ancient. No... I was born much later, after Weave was already established. Unlike those who have come from outside, like you, I am Riverborn."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny made a mental note that there was a distinction between the Outsiders and the Riverborn, and continued to listen. Ananke took a hoarse breath, then said somberly:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"But that golden age... eventually, it came to an end. First, the voices of the gods grew silent, causing the sybils to turn their gazes to the Estuary. And then... then, the Defilement was born."</p>
