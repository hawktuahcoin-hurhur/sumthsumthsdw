            <p class="chapter-paragraph">“We are self-sufficient in numerous areas, but food production still lags behind the consumption rate — despite the special influence of the Night Garden on soil and flora. So, the latest shipment of provisions was increased to account for unexpected delays during the journey... not that we know for sure how long sailing to the Eternal City will take."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">“What about those special seeds from Ravenheart? I thought we were supposed to receive one of the first batches."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">“Those are not ready to be planted yet. Apparently, the latest strains are too aggressive... whatever that means."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">“Well, if Bliss says so. I assume we also stocked up on medical supplies, household items, and so on?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Yes. But what about the consequences of your absence, Jet? Won't it have a negative effect on the situation in the Northern and Western Quadrants?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">“The old man is still alive and kicking. Effie and Kai can pick up the slack, as well. In any case, we received some breathing room because of what had happened in Australia, so I might as well take a vacation. Gods know I need a break."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Jet! Break!"Original content can be found at n̷o̷v̷e̷l̷f̷i̷r̷e̷.net</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny smiled faintly, listening to their conversation.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">At that moment, Aether, who had remained similarly quiet, spoke up from his seat:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"I think we are overlooking an important issue."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">The rest of them glanced at him, somewhat surprised. Sunny raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"What issue is that?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Aether considered his words for a few seconds, then gestured to the night sky visible through the open window.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"The stars. The journey to the Eternal City was hazardous because of where it is located, but only those who possessed a map knew where to go. Now, however, the stars charting a path to the Eternal City are visible to anyone who can look up at the sky. And any thing."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny frowned faintly.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">“Are you suggesting... what I think you are suggesting?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">The youngest of the Saints of Night nodded. "Yes, Lord Shadow. We are willing to risk the dangers of the Stormsea because of the treasures hidden in the Eternal City, as well as the great secrets that mystical place holds. But will we be the only ones lured by its promise? I don't think so."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny blinked a couple of times.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">“So we'll have competition?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Aether shrugged.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">“That is what I would assume. After all, why would powerful Nightmare Creatures not want to get their claws on a city that was once populated by immortals? All the things that we want to find there are the things they would want to consume, desecrate, or make their own."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Leaning forward a little, the young Saint said in a quiet voice:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">“You showed us a way to the Eternal City when you ignited the stars, Lord Shadow. But I am afraid that you also began a race among those who can interpret the celestial map... and the participants of that race would not hesitate to tear each other to shreds to make sure that they get to the prize first. So, this expedition is going to be even more hazardous than it was supposed to be, since we will have to contend against alarming beings making the same journey."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny remained silent for a while, then leaned back with a concerned expression. Eventually, he sighed.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Ah, but you are forgetting something, Saint Aether-"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">A pale smile split his face apart.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">“I am a terrifying being myself... I just have better manners."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny was not boasting, simply stating a fact. If he considered his powers separately from his personality, they painted the picture of quite an eldritch horror. Nephis was largely the same, if not more frightening.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">‘Wait, come to think of it..."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny's personality was not that great, either.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He remained silent for a few seconds, staring into the distance with a strange expression.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">‘Anyway... Moving on..."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">In any case, Sunny was not too worried. Which was not to say that he was not taking Aether's theory seriously.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Looking around, he lingered a little, then asked in a neutral tone:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">“Does the Night Garden carry some kind of armaments? Like cannons or enchanted siege engines?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Jet smiled lazily.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">“The ship itself is a living armament... but no, it does not. In theory, we are its armaments — Naeve, Aether, Bloodwave, and I. As well as Awakened and Ascended warriors stationed aboard."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny hummed in contemplation.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">‘So, it is more of a carrier than a battleship..."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">It made sense. A Saint was far more capable and could deliver far more damage than any siege engine ever could, enchanted or not. So, if there was something that the hull of the living ship could not handle itself, its Transcendent passengers were there to solve the problem.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">With a Supreme aboard, the firepower that the passengers of the Night Garden could unleash would increase tenfold. The problem was that Sunny could not reveal himself openly.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He considered his options for a short while, then shook his head.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"That is good and all, but having a few powerful cannons never hurts. You were in Falcon Scott, weren't you? I hear the railguns on its walls were quite something."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Jet's relaxed smile turned a few hues darker.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Yes, I was. And yes, mundane armaments were of great help... not that it mattered, in the end."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">The Saints of Night had guided plenty of naval convoys in the waking world, so they were well-acquainted with the benefits of having powerful armaments, as well. Naeve gave Sunny a confused look.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Where would we find enchanted siege engines, though? Ones worthy of the Night Garden, no less. I don't think those are just laying around, unused."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny shrugged with a smile.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"There's no need to search for them. I'll just forge them."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He was currently developing vast defensive spells to reinforce the Citadels of humanity, aided by Cassie. Arming the Night Garden was not entirely the same, but it would serve the same purpose.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Plus... the idea of making a huge, destructive magical cannon made Sunny excited.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">His smile widened.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">“Yeah. Let me scrounge something up..."</p>
