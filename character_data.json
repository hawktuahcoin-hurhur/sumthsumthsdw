Resourceful and sardonic, he survives by studying enemies, exploiting terrain, and masking his fear behind dry humor. The Spell reveals his Aspect—Shadow Slave—and the Flaw 'Clear Conscience', a constraint that forbids him from lying. His earliest victories are small but defining: reading people accurately, making ruthless decisions when cornered, and discovering that his shadow is more than a silhouette."

He acquires the Stone Saint Echo, turning an ancient statue into his stalwart guardian, and begins to think in terms of assets, risk, and long-term outcomes. Bright Castle politics test his patience and morality, while his bond with Nephis, Cassie, Kai, and Effie deepens through shared hardship. These chapters forge his leadership—not out of idealism, but out of relentless necessity and the willingness to bear difficult choices."

The Second Nightmare pushes him into Ascended, expanding both his capabilities and the burden of his decisions. Friends become responsibilities; plans become labyrinths; and every gain costs something invisible but lasting."

Yet he adapts, stacking contingencies and keeping his cohort alive through insight and grit."
