        <div class="chapter-content" data-chapter="767">
            <p class="chapter-paragraph">The news of Changing Star's return spread across the world like wildfire. The network practically exploded with an endless amount of discussions. Everyone wanted to share their excitement and celebrate the homecoming of the young hero who, without a doubt, was going to become one of the most powerful champions of humanity soon.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">While exaggerated, the reaction of both mundane humans and Awakened alike was easy to understand. In this dark and fragile world that balanced on the verge of destruction, everyone longed for something to illuminate their lives and chase their fears away. Everyone desperately searched for hope.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Thinking about it, Sunny couldn't help but remember the description of Neph's Aspect. Light Bringer...</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">[You are a creature of light that was banished and doomed to exist in the darkness. You bring radiance and warmth to wherever you go, but with it comes indescribable longing.]</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Was hope the longing it talked about? Longing was just another word for desire, after all...</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">In any case, the government had long used Nephis to satiate that desire. They had constructed an uplifting narrative around the events of the Forgotten Shore and made her the linchpin of the story.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">No matter how much Sunny hated the abhorrent movie adaptation that had been rushed through production soon after their Awakening, he had to admit that it was a sign of how deeply the survivors of the Dreamer Army and their leader had affected the public.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">To be fair, the government had not needed to work too hard to turn Changing Star into an iconic figure. Her achievements had truly been singular and remarkable. Her perceived martyrdom had truly been compelling.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">What was more, Nephis had inherited an already established and powerful legend simply on account of her birthright. Her grandfather was the first human to conquer the Second Nightmare and become a Master. Her father was the first to conquer the Third and become a Saint. Both of them were great warriors, pioneers, and revered heroes of humanity.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">...And now, she had joined their ranks by becoming the first human to Ascend directly from being a Sleeper.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Considering all that, he was not surprised to see how intensely people reacted to the news. Already, there were a lot of discussions on the network predicting that Changing Star would inevitably become the first to conquer the Fourth Nightmare and push humanity one step closer to salvation, as her parents and grandfather had done.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">If only they knew...</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">If only they knew that Sovereigns had already given up on their world, and that very soon, hundreds of millions of people would probably die for it.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">And that the hero they were praising had much grander ambitions.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Conquer the Fourth Nightmare? No, that was too trivial for Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan. She was going to conquer all Nightmares. She was going to destroy the Spell itself...</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Or at least try to, even if the waking world had to burn as the consequence.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">While the government agents ran around with panicked expressions and most of the waiting crowd dissipated, Sunny found himself leaving the group and walking away to find something to eat. Morgan of Valor had left some time ago, so he did not feel too threatened.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">'Oh, right... the true negotiations ended up never happening. I wonder what it means for my future...'</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Eventually, he settled in the hospital's cafeteria and forced himself to swallow some food. A few years ago, he would have been ecstatic to be able to feast on high-quality food like that. But now, he did not even feel the taste of various dishes. They might as well have been mimic meat or synthpaste.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny sat quietly, consumed by thoughts, when Effie suddenly appeared nearby and landed on a chair near him. There was a mountain of food on her own tray. The huntress looked at him with a smile:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Great minds think alike, huh?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">She took a bite out of a small cake, then swallowed it entirely and said with satisfaction:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"The healers want us four to come help them when Nephis wakes up. You know, in case she becomes... agitated again."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny silently nodded.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Effie sighed.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"I can't believe that she just went and Ascended... well, I can actually. It is still amazing, though! Neph must have one hell of a crazy story to tell. It might even be more unbelievable than our own."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He shrugged, then put a spoonful of something mildly spicy in his mouth.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">The huntress studied him for a while, then suddenly said:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"You know... for someone who was just reunited with their first and best friend, you don't look too happy, doofus."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny glanced at her.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Who said that we are friends?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Effie scoffed.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Don't lie to me, Sunny. I know how you feel about Nephis, and how much of it you feel. What's up with you?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He grimaced.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Lie? How can I lie?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny lowered his eyes, hesitated for a while, and then said quietly:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Stronger... I wanted to be stronger than her. I really, really tried. And to be honest, I am very annoyed that all of it was for nothing."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">The huntress looked at him with a strange expression.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Is that why you were in such a hurry to challenge the Second Nightmare?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He leaned back and turned away.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"...Yeah. That was a big part of it."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Effie lingered for a bit, then slowly shook her head.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Listen, Sunny. I am really sorry to say this... but you will never be stronger than Nephis."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">He looked at her sharply, sparks of anger igniting in his eyes:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"Oh yeah? Why is that?"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">She sighed.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"It's very simple, really. Both of you are exceptional, talented, and have great will. Both of you are incredibly strong. But, Sunny... it doesn't matter how fast you gain a new Rank, how many Nightmare Creatures you kill, how many soul fragments you absorb. She will always be ahead."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">She looked him in the eyes and said soberly:</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"It's because she has something that you lack. Nephis, she has... conviction, Sunny. And you don't. As long as that doesn't change, you will always be behind."</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">As he stared at her with resentment, Effie suddenly grinned and shrugged.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">"But hey... who cares? I have even less conviction than you, and I'm doing great. Who needs it, anyway... I would much rather have a full belly than something like that!"</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">With that, she laughed and returned to her food, not paying the conversation any more attention.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">Sunny, however, remained still for some time.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">A somber expression appeared on his face.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">After a while, he sighed and silently resumed eating his meal.</p>
<p class="chapter-paragraph">'Conviction... conviction... who needs it, indeed...'</p>
