            <p>Nephis nodded.</p>
<p>"Song and Valor are going to be in a race to conquer it. They will search for Nightmare Gates that can be used to establish a beachhead in the unexplored region of the Dream Realm where the black pyramid is located. Once they find a comparatively safe fort, they will use the Call to transport their Saints, Masters, and Awakened there, establishing temporary outposts."</p>
<p>She paused. Looked at him, and continued:</p>
<p>"These outposts will be used to launch expeditions toward the pyramid. The end goal is to find a relatively safe place in close proximity to it, build a true fortress there, and then use that fortress as the staging ground for the conquest of the Tomb."</p>
<p>Changing Star lingered for a moment.</p>
<p>"It might be easier to think of it in terms of the Forgotten Shore. Each Gate is connected to a Seed of Nightmare somewhere in the region. Some Seeds might be in the depths of the Crimson Labyrinth, and everyone who follows the Call to the area around them will be drowned by the Dark Sea. Some Seeds, however, might be located on higher ground-those who enter the Dream Realm near these Seeds will be able to survive, and then slowly make their way through the labyrinth. l?ghtnоvеlcave. The end goal is to find a place like the Dark City, build a fortress akin to the Bright Castle, and then use it to conquer the Crimson Spire."</p>
<p>"What an apt metaphor."</p>
<p>Sunny couldn't help but smile darkly.</p>
<p>"They might find out that this task is much harder than they imagine it to be."</p>
<p>In theory, such a plan seemed solid. Each of the hundreds, if not thousands of Nightmare Gates in East Antarctica was connected to a Seed of Nightmare in the region surrounding the Tomb of Ariel. By relying on the Call, these Gates could be used to enter the Dream Realm somewhere near the corresponding Seed.</p>
<p>Then, by pinpointing a suitably safe area and the Gate connected to it, the great clans could transport their forces into the Dream Realm without risking instant annihilation. These forces would then explore and fight their way toward the black pyramid.</p>
<p>The region could contain several Citadels, even by conquering one, Song or Valor would be able to establish a safe and stable corridor to ferry fighters and supplies over. if there were no Citadels except for the Tomb of Ariel itself, though, the Saints would have to play the role of ferrymen.</p>
<p>But... the mysterious desert was utterly lethal. It was much worse than even the Forgotten Shore. And the forces of the great clans would not only have to fight against the endless flood of Nightmare Creatures populating it - they would also have to fight against each other.</p>
<p>Sunny couldn't help but shiver. Nephis, meanwhile, simply nodded.</p>
<p>"The task will be a hellish one, indeed. But these are the great clans, Sunny... no matter how you and I might feel about them, their fearsome reputation is not unearned. Both Valor and Song represent the absolute pinnacle of human achievement in warfare. If they can't do it, no one can."</p>
<p>He remained silent for a while, thinking.</p>
<p>The real goal of the great clans was to kill each other, while their secondary goal was to conquer the Tomb of Ariel. One naturally led to the other. He now knew that the siege capitals in Antarctica would remain mostly untouched by their war, at least... unless something unexpected happened.</p>
<p>However, both clans would be feverishly seeking suitable Gates in East Antarctica, without doubt ambushing and slaughtering each other in the process. Army patrols and the infrastructure of the evacuation corridors could very well become collateral damage in their clashes. Not to mention that they were bound to send the Nightmare Creatures into a frenzy... and maybe even lead the abominations back to the cities.</p>
<p>There would be some violence within the siege capitals, as well, or at least: bloody clandestine operations. All three of the Saints currently present in East Antarctica belonged to the warring factions after all... if the servants of Ki Song had an opportunity to deal with Saint Tyris in Falcon Scott, they would have taken it, without a doubt the consequences for the civilians sheltered</p>
<p>in the city be damned.</p>
<p>'Bastards...'</p>
<p>In any case, Sunny had some idea about how things would progress in the coming months now. This was already enough for him to start thinking.</p>
<p>Eventually, he glanced at Nephis and hesitated for a few moments. There was one question that was still gnawing at him...</p>
<p>Sunny sighed.</p>
<p>"And where will you be while all of this is happening?"</p>
<p>Nephis looked at him. White sparks danced in her eyes, and then, she suddenly smiled.</p>
<p>"Where do you think? Of course, I will be accompanying Morgan... sister dearest... to Antarctica. Cassie, the Fire Keepers, and I - all of us are going there with her. l?ghtnоvеlcave. I've told you that Valor does not trust me much, yet. What better way to earn trust and merit than on the battlefield?"</p>
<p>He stared at her silently for a while.</p>
<p>"I guess there is none. So, we are going to meet in the Southern Quadrant?"</p>
<p>Changing Star shrugged.</p>
<p>"If you wish. Or... you can stay out of this mess entirely. You have made it very clear that you don't want to have anything to do with the great clans and their war, so... it's up to you if and how much you get involved."</p>
<p>Sunny smiled darkly.</p>
<p>"Up to me, huh?"</p>
<p>'Yeah, no... that ship has sailed.'</p>
<p>He really could hide in some remote siege capital, use his service record and exalted status to get himself a cushy assignment, and spend the rest of the campaign relaxing... as much anyone could relax in Antarctica. However, was he willing to?</p>
<p>Did he want to?</p>
<p>...Not really.</p>
<p>'If I do not go to hell, who else will go?'</p>
<p>Sunny had once told the Sin of Solace that the great clans were free to act with impunity because there was no one around to hold them responsible. He did not wish to teach anyone lessons in responsibility... But he did want to teach those bastards a lesson in humility. The harsher and more painful the lesson, the better.</p>
<p>'I'll make them pay... if I go to hell, I'll drag them with me...'</p>
<p>Sunny looked at the boundless blue sky, then turned to Nephis and smiled.</p>
<p>"See you in Antarctica, then."</p>
