            <p>2575 The Chain</p>
<p>The [Weakening Curse] empowered Sunny to defy the very constraints of his supposed capabilities. His latent Dormant Ability, [Shadow Manipulation], was what allowed the invaluable shadows under his command to bolster him — extending their influence not only over himself but also to objects in his possession and entities under his Domain’s sway.</p>
<p>In like manner, whenever the [Enfeebling Hex] was engaged, those gripped by the frigid clutches of his shadows would find their strength diminishing. Naturally, this effect accumulated over time; just as Sunny's power magnified with each shadow that reinforced him, his rivals’ vigor waned further with every additional shadow entwining them.</p>
<p>There were battle scenarios where sapping the opponent's power proved more advantageous than fortifying one’s own. Choosing which path to pursue demanded careful judgment—and prudence, too—since embracing a dangerous foe with his shadows was rarely a risk-free tactic.</p>
<p>Even setting aside the hazards of marking a lethal adversary with the [Enfeebling Hex], the practical value of this curse appeared situational at best, and perhaps dubious at worst—particularly when weighed against Sunny’s innate powers.</p>
<p>Yet, the [Enfeebling Hex] concealed two reasons it was far more terrifying than it seemed.</p>
<p>The first was the [Underworld Armament]. The second lay in its harmony with the [Shadow Ember] and the [Shadows Mercy].</p>
<p>Together, [Shadow Ember], [Shadow’s Mercy], and the [Enfeebling Hex]...</p>
<p>“Each enchantment held its own merits, but their true strength was unlocked when combined.</p>
<p>[Shadow Ember] enabled Sunny to disperse the empowerment of his shadows over vast numbers. This meant the [Enfeebling Hex] could similarly afflict countless victims.</p>
<p>Who was to say he had to curse only seven foes, or a single fearsome enemy seven times over? Paired with [Shadow Ember], the [Enfeebling Hex] granted him the power to drain the strength of thousands—tens of thousands, or even millions—should he so desire.</p>
<p>But that was far from the end.</p>
<p>Sunny and his shadows were intertwined, each a vessel of his will. All beings augmented or diminished by them remained linked to him, forging conduits through which he could channel his Death Will.</p>
<p>And, of course, this Death Will was itself magnified by [Shadow’s Mercy].</p>
<p>All these—the boost from [Shadow Ember], the sinister drain of the [Enfeebling Hex], and the merciless execution of [Shadow's Mercyl—were further amplified by the presence of the [Underworld Armament].</p>
<p>In essence, if Sunny chose to share his shadows’ enhancements with a thousand specters, their boon would surpass even his own. If he weakened a thousand Nightmare Entities, the total power they lost outstripped what he would have gained.</p>
<p>His Death Will also rose astronomically...</p>
<p>So potent was it that his mere killing intent could slay lesser-ranked creatures outright— recalling the faint, distant echo of Nether's fatal will that once nearly took Sunny’s life in the Great River's storm.</p>
<p>Nephis could obliterate a horde of Nightmare Creatures with one mighty blast. Yet, with the chilling synergy between [Shadow Ember], the [Enfeebling Hex], and [Shadow’s Mercy], Sunny no longer needed such displays.</p>
<p>Simply willing their demise was enough, and their soulless forms would collapse ifelessly.</p>
<p>Granted, Nephis's annihilations still wielded greater sheer destruction. But now, Sunny could put on a performance nearly as impressive—a solution he devised to compensate for the glaring weaknesses in his otherwise remarkably versatile Aspect.</p>
<p>“Quite fitting, for one who names himself the Sovereign of Death, wouldn't you say?’ Gazing out across the looming darkness of the ancient city sprawling before him, Sunny let a faint smile cross his lips.</p>
<p>For reasons he couldn't pinpoint, he felt momentarily divine. The feats enabled by the Hex weren't necessarily grander than his usual powers—just different. Yet, the ability to slay with naught but a glance and a wish felt like a power far beyond mortal ken. It was a grace belonging solely to those who straddled the line between godhood and humanity. Of course, Sunny might already have wielded something akin to that, albeit in a limited fashion. It was more a lack of opportunity—and desire—to unleash his Death Will fully upon mere mortals, as well as a scarcity of encounters with lower-ranked Nightmare Creatures, that had kept him from using it.</p>
<p>Sunny exhaled deeply.</p>
<p>only ever seem to battle the outrageously strong...’</p>
<p>Granted, he himself was no exception to that rule.</p>
<p>At last, there remained the curse's final enchantment...</p>
<p>The [Chain].</p>
<p>Both a practical tool and an ultimate weapon, the [Chain] was what made the curse a complex Memory—and now an Attribute—allowing its seven links to empower one another when united.</p>
<p>Passively, the [Chain] steadily amplified the curse’s potency as Sunny enhanced himself through his shadows. Yet it could only reach its full awakening when all seven of his incarnations merged into one and all seven links assembled as a single chain.</p>
<p>When active, the [Chain] generated a powerful resonance between its individual links, making their combined strength far surpass the mere sum of each part—granting every enchantment within the curse a terrible surge of power.</p>
<p>The [Chain] also possessed a secondary power in this awakened state.</p>
<p>it could be summoned to physically bind a target—be it object or foe.</p>
<p>Here, the [Chain] embodied the essence of permanence.</p>
<p>This made it equally viable for offense or defense.</p>
<p>It could trap a formidable enemy in place.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it could bind Sunny himself, anchoring a snapshot of his being to the fabric of reality. No matter how his body was ravaged afterward, as long as the [Chain] remained active, it would return to its prior form.</p>
<p>“The same applied to his soul, mind, and spirit.</p>
<p>So, if he needed to use Shadow Dance and risked losing himself in the process... in theory, the [Chain] could tether him back.</p>
<p>It served as a lifeline, binding Sunny to himself at least until he reclaimed his True Name. That was his hope—yet, as with all concepts delving into higher planes and abstract forces, the exact outcomes were unpredictable. The enchantment's mysteries even eluded its own creator. Still, Sunny held a peculiar fondness for the [Chain].</p>
<p>His existence had grown increasingly tenuous and ephemeral ever since all traces of him were erased from reality. No longer tethered by fate, and with the fragile threads of human connection frayed to near nothing, he was no longer anchored to the world.</p>
<p>So the [Chain] stood as his anchor instead. A tool by which he could secure himself firmly within existence—no longer a fleeting illusion at the mercy of anything as trivial as the wind.</p>
<p>Releasing a quiet breath, Sunny smiled and withdrew the Jade Mantle, drawing the curse back into the depths of his soul.</p>
<p>After years of planning and painstaking crafting of this brilliant weave, he had finally forged his own shadowbound relic...</p>
<p>He had created the Curse.</p>
<p>Humming a simple tune, Sunny set forth toward the Dark Castle.</p>
<p>“All things considered... I'd say it turned out quite well.’</p>
<p>Now, all he craved was rest.</p>
